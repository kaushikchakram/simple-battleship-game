# simple-battleship-game
## This battleship game is based on a exercise in Codecademy.
### This repository contains a very simple implementation of the battleship game in python that the user can run.
It contains the main file `battleship_game.py` which the user(s) can run in their local computer. 

## The Setup/Rules for this game is as follows:
One Battle Ship is placed on the Ocean at Random by the computer and the user has to guess where the Battle Ship is located. 
+ The user plays against the computer.
+ The Ocean is 5 X 5 a grid.
+ The user has to enter an integer between 0 to 4 to indicate their guess for the location of the Row.
+ Again the user has to enter an integer between 0 to 4 to indicate their guess for the location of the Column.
+ The user can take up to 4 turns (if needed) to guess where the ship is located.
+  If the user is unsuccessful to guess the Battle Ship's location within the alloted 4 turns, then the computer Wins the Game.
+ If the user is unsucessful to guess the Battle Ship's location (at the end of the game), then the the board is displayed with the Battle Ship's actual location.
+ The Board is also displayed with the user's guess of the Battle Ship location at the end of each turn.

#### The Legend used for displaying the "Ocean" 5 X 5 Grid is as follows: 
+ The **Ocean** is indicated with an `"O"`.
+ The **Unsucessful user guess for the Batlle Ship location** is marked with a `"X"`.
+  The **Actual location of the Battle Ship location** is marked with a `"S"`.
